"""Find the Home Assistant release CI checks against.

`_validate.yml` runs the tests, mypy --strict and hassfest against one Home
Assistant release: the newest stable one that
pytest-homeassistant-custom-component has been released for. A beta, a
release candidate or a dev build never counts. The package pins Home
Assistant exactly (`homeassistant==2026.9.4`), so its newest releases name
the newest Home Assistant releases, and a new stable release reaches CI
without a change in this repository (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Continuous
integration"):

    python3 .github/scripts/ha_version.py           # key=value lines for $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    python3 .github/scripts/ha_version.py --plugin  # the package version alone

It reads PyPI's JSON API and prints `home_assistant` and `plugin` (the
package version) as `key=value` lines, and what it found on stderr, for the
run's log.

Standard library only, and 3.12-compatible, like the release script: the
hassfest job runs it on the runner's own Python.
