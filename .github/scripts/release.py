"""Compute the next release version and its release notes.

`release.yml`'s key job (the one holding `RELEASE_DEPLOY_KEY`, so it runs no
third-party action -- see CONTRIBUTING.md, "Releases") calls this script
through the shell, never imports it:

    python3 .github/scripts/release.py plan --type stable --bump auto --for-release
    python3 .github/scripts/release.py notes --from v2.0.0_redesign --to HEAD

`plan` reads the current checkout's tags and commit log and prints
`version`, `tag` and `previous` as `key=value` lines for `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`;
`--for-release`, which only the release passes, makes it refuse a plan the
release must not publish (see `plan`). `notes` prints the Markdown release
notes for a commit range. Both are thin wrappers around the pure functions
below (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Releases").

Standard library only, and 3.12-compatible: `actions/setup-python` is
GitHub's own action, but the key job goes without it -- the release allows
that job only `actions/checkout` and shell (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Releases") --
so this runs on the Python `ubuntu-24.04` ships, 3.12.
`_validate_repository.yml`'s "Release script" job compiles and runs it
there on every change.
